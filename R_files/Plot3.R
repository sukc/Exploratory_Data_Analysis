#Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable,
#which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? 
#Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make 
#a plot answer this question.
#Ans Decreased : for non-road,non-point and on-road type , Increased :Piont type
